          You need to create an application similar to the one that you are

          the current homepage.

              The people can go to this page, by clicking the `People` tab in
              the Navbar The data should be fetched from
              https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users (Users API call) using
              Static Site Generation (SSG) for this page. Hence the people page
              will be rendered from the server, with all the data present in the
              HTML file itself

              The people can go to this page, by clicking the `Get Todos` button
              in the User Cards All the static HTML files, based on the static
              paths of the user id, should be created using SSG The HTML files
              should have the UserID:[id] data present in their HTML pages
              (Check screenshots for examples) The TodoData should be fetched
              from https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users/$id/todos using
              Client Side Rendering, and shown in the UI after the page loads
              Visting any other dynamic route based on the user id which is not
              in the API should show the 404 page. For example, from the Users
              API call, none of the user has the 97 user id, hence, visiting
              http://localhost:3000/people/97 should return 404 page
